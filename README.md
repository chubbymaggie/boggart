# Hulk

Hulk is a microservices-based system for mutation testing of code written
in arbitrary languages. Hulk is built on top of the small-but-mighty Rooibos,
a language-independent platform for source code transformation.

Currently, Hulk comes prepackaged with a collection of mutation operators
that target programs written in the following languages:

* C
* C++
